# Coffee-Shop-Management-System
This is my group project with 2 friends in class. And this is a cafe management system application that helps managers monitor and manage business processes. But this is just UI/UX part and has no connection to database.
All tasks are assigned in the SRS file. 
I am the team leader and responsible for designing the login interface, the waiter interface and tracking throughout the project.
